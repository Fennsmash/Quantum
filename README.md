The Quantum Cycle of Natural Beauty

A *story* of everything

Leo Emerson

1/20/21

This document has information about quantum mechanics and it might be difficult for some to follow. We’ve always needed (storytellers) to (communicate), and (scientists) to (tell us what) to communicate. *Nature comes first*. Then the story. Then the science. Then understanding/truth. [I think] Until we get the story right, we cannot get the science right. In discussing philosophy with Discord folks, I am learning this is in line with the metaphysical approach taken by Plato/forms and many philosophers before him. It is contrary to the more epistemological/Aristotelian framework we follow today, which relies heavily on observation and not stories. In this “paper”. I reach as far into (science/biology/psychology/quantum biology/neuropsychology etc.) that I can to tie *all* current knowledge together, in a story.  Plato, I think would have supported writing something like this as *the* correct approach to the problems in Physics today, given the wealth of relevant knowledge from other fields that Physics does not necessarily (usually/ever) incorporate. 

I tried to write this in a way that is as in-between-logic-and-language as I could. It’s not a normal Physics paper. I don’t know if that makes it better or worse to be honest. I thought it (is/was) a good way to tell the story of *us*. With…balance, between (science/epistemology) AND (stories/art/metaphysics). I also wanted to give this every bit of (dimension/depth/texture/emotional-oomph) as I could, while also staying true to some semblance of order. I hope scientists *and* regular people like me can all see that this story makes sense, like it does to me. So, it starts off with a very brief period of poetry/art then goes into the more science-y stuff. It is very much a story, not a “paper” per se, it’s my “story of everything” not my theory-of-it, and there will be common-sense parts about nature and the way the world works to “anchor” how the rest of the super weird stuff fits in. The science part starts of very simple, and does progressively get more into quantum mechanics/Physics. It will lose some people, but hopefully without the story losing its meaning.

I digress. (my fingers hurt/landscaping duty(::cracks knuckles::). No but really I am actually going to start the more story part of the story-poem now and it will be back to kind of having to think again so strap in (comfortably) And so my/our real story begins/ends=>>>

We started the quantum endeavor long ago first by asking ourselves existential questions about the real world. We got really good at it, and became scientists. It wasn’t long ago that we discovered cells. Cellular biology was an era of amazing new possibilities. And then we got to quantum, there is so much more going on in the universe than we could have imagined. I just found out there already is a field of Quantum Biology that demonstrates biological “control” of particle activity is happening. Genius Physicists have been attacking the math like piranha with the best tools in history and we’re hitting very clear road blocks. We need to stop doing the same thing over and over again while expecting the same results. We need to change our attack a little; we need to stand on the shoulders of all the amazing Physicists AND the shoulders of Biologists AND Neurobiologists and everyone else who is studying quantum activity. 

(This document+Fennsmash(v?)) is my answer to why everybody who writes a theory of everything fails and always will – because we all need to write it together. The best someone like me (who is on this journey of wisdom with you) can do is help us plan a better attack. The rest we have to do together. My overall conclusion: we have asked all of our questions about the world, for thousands of years (7ish million I think if we count all hominin/ds), and because we lacked the proper context, we have gotten very *sure* of things we shouldn’t have. In my other document, I explain that we live in one dimension, and that’s a lot to handle so don’t worry about it here! We’re not going to become pancakes, we just didn’t define a dimension perfectly either.

Again, this is just a story; it is human and imperfect and it can be nothing more than that, but if you are ok with that, then it *is* ok to use it as a tool to help navigate our path. I had to make up the Physics from scratch in my head, parts are [almost definitely] wrong, so it is not a perfect story, but it is *our* story, and this is the best I can do to tell it. It needs to go from me => you => the Physics/Math/Bio/Neuro heroes who can do amazing things with it. I am just the storyteller. That is my role. (And I love it.)

Voice emerges from the abyss: Questions dear story’s premise of promise of perfect bliss, to point us to the path we push to pursue punctually post-haste lest it we miss within the mist=>

“This sounds very interesting to us. How can you help us get the answer?”

Oh wow, didn’t see you there, let’s take 5 for a second or 3.
We need to ause. Ause. Au(..Pause. Anyone know where all the p’s went?) And make sure we know what answer we are asking for. Would it be fair to say you want the answer to the ultimate question?

“Yes please.”

What is the ultimate question?
“8 billion people all speak at once”
….I see. I heard a lot of incredibly interesting questions. The ultimate answer is a gift for everyone. We have to agree on the ultimate question. How do we choose the ultimate one out of so many? These are a few I heard:

1.	Who are we?
2.	What are we?
3.	Is there a God?
4.	What happens when we die?

….which one is the ultimate one?
“4 billion people all speak at once”
“4 billion people are all silent at once for the first time ever”

I know this doesn’t seem like a productive start but it is! Right now, in this moment, we can see we need a blank slate. We are going to remove any biases that we have, conscious, unconscious, and even ones where we just really like our personal science or spirituality a lot. They are both super valuable, but we have to come together to answer this question. Does anyone think this is a worse idea than continuing to do the same problems over and over again while expecting different results?

“4 billion people say: this is great!”
“3 billion people say: you’re not exactly getting us anywhere but ok I don’t hate it”
“1 billion people say: show us some <3Math<3!”
(50% pro/50% not against)! Motion passed! [world’s first Physics pun happens immediately]
We are doing great. We have a blank slate, and we know we are chasing the ultimate question. We need some context. What can we figure out about the ultimate question, just from its nature, without any other information to reference? After a group-of-8-billion discussion:

1.	The ultimate question can be asked
2.	The ultimate question can be answered
3.	If we ask the ultimate question, we will get the ultimate answer
4.	We need to know the ultimate question in order to ask it
5.	We don’t currently know the ultimate question

It looks like a dead end, but it isn’t. I (never/rarely) paid attention in class and I aced so many math tests just by plugging in numbers for ‘x’ that I thought looked right until one fit. A few days ago, I was able to make a question work here, to help us answer the above, below. I’m going to walk you through how asking myself one question took me from inside my own head, and into a black hole. I found out how we can cheat our way past physics without the math. I just thought out the answer to *one* very long question, and it gave me (I think) a great viewpoint of the ultimate answer. 

This is The Quantum Cycle of Natural Beauty – the Platonic/metaphysical solution to (“what are we”/“what does it mean to *(experience/exist)*”)(?).

We’re not going to go chronologically; we’ll start by addressing one of the all-encompassing facts of science: nature is cyclical. In order understand quantum physics, and its universe-spanning units of nature, wouldn’t it be sensible to look for a cycle?

I do my best to equate concepts to computers, which do an excellent job of providing context, but I had to make a few (names/words) up. I am not a Physicist. I guessed the Physics here based on nerdy self-study and some things my Mom told me this past week while I was freaking out about all this. I didn’t need any Math, I just had to ask myself a lot of questions. As I said, I reached as far into science as I could, but someone needs to finish the rest; that’s how cycles work.
 
Here goes:
 
It starts with the logical distinction between body and mind. Really isolating what each one is, giving *each* the *context* we need in order to start thinking about what’s *more*:

1.	Our bodies exist in the non-quantum world (total common sense, we (see/hear/touch) = We experience things)
2.	There’s really 2 things we do, we collect information from the world around us with sensory organs, and we process this data in our brains. Talking to other people is sounds, sights, touching; some of the many amazing things we can sense by interacting with each other.
3.	Our sensory organs (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin) are *constantly* collecting data from the world around us, whether we choose to *notice* or not. Like not paying attention to the tv, or your teacher, or your partner. You’re just not paying attention to the sound input (we’re human, we can’t hear ALL the sounds and see ALL the things at the same time!)
4.	So, our brain is the amazing thing that helps us experience all of this. The information from outside hits our sensory organs, and then shoots/travels up to our brain. 
5.	Our brain is incredible. We don’t fully understand it. Science has gotten a TON of [I think] fascinating answers, but not all of them. Like, sleep? We’d all really like to know why all living creatures need sleep, but only the ones with brains, wouldn’t we? What’s the big difference between is and bacteria in soil? What we do know, is our brain collects, sorts, and processes information or better said as “data” for us for now.
a.	Recent update: Quantum biology is a field that has shown evidence of biological structures manipulating the quantum world by “creating ideal environments” for “quantum stability”. I can’t go too into the science yet, but it is already being studied (for ~10 years) AND they are also studying bird brains and quantum implications in their navigational system. Seems very reasonable to the Physicist in me.
b.	Also, specific to brains, neuropsychologists in the past 5-10 years have discovered that *white matter* might be *more* active than gray matter. White matter is ~80% of our brain. The study has said: if neurons are like electrical wires, then GABA is like WiFi. This sounds VERY quantum and weird, yes, Physicists?

This concept is the first critical element: Defining our bodies. Everything from our eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and skin is all non-quantum and we have a good idea how this stuff works. We even have a *ton* of amazing medicines because of science. Everything in our brains from structures, to neurons, to neurotransmitters, everything we study in biochemistry and biological processes, it all can be considered “hardware”. Its function is to collect, process, and store data. This isn’t romantic, but it’s the science we already know with a different name, hardware. It’s easy context. We are seeing potential quantum “involvement” within the brain and with cells, and it manifests as a kind of symbiosis.

What interested me was: Sometimes I notice a sound that I know has been going on for a while, but I know I’m just becoming aware of it. Our brains aren’t able to hear all sounds at once, but if we want to, and we close our eyes, and focus (as in many meditations), we are able to *notice* sounds we didn’t *notice* before. If the “data” from all sounds around us exists in a wave form before it comes anywhere near our body, what is happening to sounds we don’t notice? What happens that is *different* in the sounds we do notice? *Something* is different. We haven’t completely figured this out in the biology or biochemistry or neurology fields, because the answer is quantum (though they are making progress in their respective fields *without* (I think) much help from the Physicists who know a lot more about this stuff. 90+ years of it vs. ~10. Why not help each other out?

So the question is: (What does it mean to experience/to be(or not))?

I hope you love how close Shakespeare was as much as I do. I’m kind of just the person taking his time to give Will a great answer. ‘What does it mean to experience’ (and to be or not to be) is my ultimate question. Maybe there’s a better one, but since 8 billion people can’t decide, we’re going with it!

It isn’t a straight path to the finish line, but with all my self-taught nerd-power I went deeper and deeper, cycle inside of bigger cycle, until one of them took me into a black hole (I’m in there now, help!).

Onto more science! I love science SO much!! You don’t have to though; I can love it for the both of us while I tell you about it: 

We know from our science labs how waves and particles work. Data travels around in waves (like sounds). There’s things like molecule-sized smells too but those aren’t the same (*wildly* different actually), and we’re not talking about them for now. We have been studying this wave and particle stuff (particle physics/quantum mechanics) for a long time, almost 100 years, and we’ve learned a lot about the particles traveling around as waves. The whole reason I started liking the quantum world was because I watched the double slit experiment. If you don’t know what it is, oh my goodness it is the most mind-blowing science experiment ever. It’s all over YouTube too, and it is absolutely proven science so I’m not stepping into any weird areas yet.

The consolidated version is: when scientists study waves, they can see their effect. For example, the effects of *blasting* music will shake an entire room. Anyway, so what’s weird, is the second they try to get a look at any actual wave itself, it magically turns into a particle. And that’s a really weird magic trick, but if they just look at it and it looks different from what they thought then no big deal. What is mind-blowing about it is, it doesn’t just look different, it does different things. It would be like if you were a boy when I looked at you and then you turned into a girl when I wasn’t looking at you. I am NOT exaggerating or kidding in any way, this is a very good analogy for what happens in actual science labs and has been for ~50ish years.

Every time, without question, when we directly measure a wave, look at it, observe it in ANY way in science labs, 100% of the time it changes from a boy into a girl. I’m kidding obviously, but it does totally change its behavior. I have to trust you get this, otherwise I will go on and on. That is SO crazy/cool to me. Just looking at something literally changes not only how it looks but how it acts in actual science. I will fail at writing out a cool example, but go online and look for a video, it is very trippy.

What I am proposing, is this doesn’t just happen in science labs. When we as human beings become *aware* of a sound, in that exact instant, the wave has been *observed*, and it is *removed* from the quantum world. What happens to sounds we don’t become aware of? Nothing. They stay in the quantum world as waves. 

The answer I have for “the measurement problem” is drawn in picture form here. *Time* is the missing element in the equation, AND the measuring machine is totally irrelevant. If the particle or anything it does is directly measured by a living being, at ANY point in the history of time in the future, then it just *has* collapsed. It doesn’t become a *when* question, it is more of a binary: true or not(true). True if the time loop is created (also, there is either a time loop or not a time loop, so this follows the same (true/not true) principle), and not(true) if it is not (completed/ever created). This is *only* done by a *living* observer – including a cat hidden in a box. Schrodinger’s cat is never both alive and dead because *it* (experiences/observes) just like we do. So does a cockroach. Anything with a brain. Observation can be when we look at the hard drive, if hear our device make a sound, smell it somehow, or look at the screen.
  
So what happens now that we have seen a sight or heard a sound or smelled a smell? We collapsed a wave into a particle - what then? It would almost definitely be stored in our brains somewhow (how that works TBD). It would then, most likely, ultimately need to be released back into the quantum world – via brain waves. At all times, and especially at night, it is already well-known that we are releasing a lot of strange brain waves out into “the ether”. If this is a cycle, it would mean we are actively converting non-quantum data (the data we removed from the quantum world) back into quantum data. So, one thing in the quantum world, another in non-quantum(*perceived reality*). A nice, neat cycle as demonstrated by this picture:

 



“Can we get some natural language definitions going to (clarify/keep track of) what you are attempting to communicate to us?”

My heart just melted. It would be my pleasure. Did you know I also love charts?





Story definitions so far:
(Our non-quantum reality/how most people think today)	(Nature/Plato’s ‘forms’ version in this story – or a sort of “quantum reality”)
data	information
particle	wave
body	hardware
brain	hardware that also acts as a quantum processor, causing the cycle between (particles/waves/particles/waves) to happen via continuously “experiencing” particles via sensory organs


So as you might notice, not only do we have our first definition, we already have our first unanswered HUGE science solution! We figured out sleep before we even got to gravity. Sleep (lots of brain wave things are known to happen) is likely to be our hardware (brain) converting non-quantum data back into quantum data. The human brain is a quantum processor/computer. 

Creative people, many geniuses, who think in a more “quantum” state during the day, store and process data differently. All people can think in the “quantum state”, some just do it more often. They seem scatterbrained, loopy, out of touch with reality (the non-quantum reality) and they have less need for sleep because they have not collected as much non-quantum data throughout the day, and therefore need less time converting it at night. Many people are forcing themselves to stick to an unnecessary sleep routine. (Waking up on time for work) > (going to bed on time). What’s most “natural” would be going to sleep when tired and waking up with sunlight. (See: Sunlight Wake-up Call poem).

So, what is the relationship between our hardware, this quantum computer and its inputs, and the quantum world? This is the second and most major concept: the quantum world and the non-quantum world (the two components that together make us *alive*) act not as one thing, because they are not one thing - but more like two separate *entities* existing in a cyclical, symbiotic relationship; one existing in the non-quantum world and the other in the quantum world. This doesn’t change a thing about us at all; we would assume this is already happening. It’s just another way to look at it, that makes sense of this crazy world. It would also be a LOT like saying dreams are just our experience of the “quantum reality”, it’s not so scary when you think about it like that. It gives much more meaning to dreams – and studies have shown that rats will exhibit the same brain patterns while they sleep, as they did while learning a maze during the day. The same areas of the brain become active as the rat “processes” this data at night. It also is in line with Eastern philosophies and meditation: meditation is just us “ignoring” the non-quantum sounds so we can focus on our “quantum experience”. The only reason it sounds remotely bas is because we don’t have names for this process yet.

Now, we continue the Platonic solution and think out what would have to happen next. This is the fun part - *anyone* reading this can just guess at Physics assuming this one (to me) palatable (context/truth/axiom). The rest is all speculation, but what follows is a neatly ordered picture:

Our hardware collects, stores, and processes data in our brains, and converts it back into quantum data, into what I will call for now ‘the essence field’ (defined later in this paper as akin to memory). But what would the point be? There is no overall change in the universe after a cycle of data being “reformatted” from wave to particle and back again.

This is where it gets fun. I will now address a possible answer for universal expansion, and everything will cascade from there. Hold on to your seats I’m making this up but it works, and that *should* be taken into consideration when *experimentation* has gotten to its limits (in testing black holes etc.) 

The universe is expanding, what could that be? Creating something out of nothing is the easy explanation, but in physics we can’t do that. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed, right? Or is that energy? Well – what if we are not just converting particles into waves and then back again. If we did that, there’s nothing being added to the sum. What’s missing? If particles are like little (data/information) packets, what would happen when we (undertake/experience) the actual *process* of processing them? That’s new, shouldn’t that create a new data packet?

It makes sense (conceptually/metaphysically) that the *experience* of *experiencing* this process happen also occurs. In and of itself, this *experience-experience* would have to become *new* quantum data, that came from *nothing* in the quantum OR physical world. This *experience particle* is my explanation for dark matter; an unseen – and probably unseeable – quantum data particle. It is one byproduct of our quantum brains *experiencing* the cycle of processing non-quantum information.

So now 1,000 things come up: If this is true, then, what is space time, what is gravity, where and how is this data stored? Those are some of the many questions that went racing through my mind, and I am going to answer here. I don’t know exactly where to start but I’ll go with the concept of gravity (this won’t be short).

The way to answer this is still in computer terms. We have our quantum computer, doing all this processing, and creating this brand new “unobservable-dark-matter-experience particle” (maybe I can name it after my Mom?) but what happens to the original wave’s data? If we create these new “essence particles” by experiencing an already existing input of data, we need to explain a way for both to come out AND address the fact that plenty of matter was here before brains. I think if a “story” like this is to be effective, you need to answer all of that AND tie in science when you do it. The more you stretch the less likely you are “onto” something – and the less you have to, the clearer it becomes that you (likely) are putting the right pieces together:

There are 2 (and probably more) very key particles physics is missing, and we have 2 (and probably more) very distinct particles (we/I) think come out of our brain at this point.  Why make more work for ourselves; the second byproduct of our “biological quantum computing” is likely the *graviton* particle (the original particle we collapsed and experienced). The “experience particle” would then likely be the elusive *dark matter particle*. We don’t need to worry about how all this *works* yet, we just know the picture is coming together so far and we haven’t had to stretch yet, just adding what’s known into the places it fits. 

But, we do need to keep making things make sense:

As we know, nature is cyclical. We little humans aren’t making enough data to shake up the cosmos, so what else is there? Well, this cycle of ((being awake & experiencing) & (creating new non-quantum data from nothing)), and then ((sleeping) & (reformatting non-quantum data into gravitons + essence particles)), would occur in *all* beings who follow this sleep cycle (things that don’t sleep actually have what are called motor proteins; these act a lot like an autonomous nervous system and are the “auto pilot” for things without a brain). This cycle is happening right now, on Earth, all day, every day, and everywhere in the universe, and it has been for over 4 billion years since life with brains sprang up. NOW we are talking MASSIVE amounts of data on a cosmic scale. This is still only half of the picture – maybe ¼. (I believe we have stated “dark matter” is constant and not increasing – but this would be refuted simply in understanding that if we aren’t going to notice a change in the ocean by adding a drop to it; we aren’t going to notice a change in the universe either). If we do show an increase in Dark Matter at some point, it would be evidence to support this (theory/story).

We still need to know:
1.	What happens with the data once it’s released in brain waves?
2.	Where in “spacetime” is it going?
3.	What is “spacetime” in this context
4.	What are the properties of these particles?

There’s a LOT more to ask, but to get back to gravity, let’s ask this: what would need to happen in the quantum world, in order for this to be a complete cycle?
1.	Data = both in the form of gravitons AND “essence particle” – would have to exist, or, be *stored* in some way. 
2.	Essence particles = the sought-after reward (new data), so Nature would want to keep them *safe*
3.	Gravitons = either another type of *less wanted* already experienced data, OR they are *blank data* in quantum form. Either way, they definitely seem less desirable to Nature (though still important) than the “essence particle”
4.	Gravitons need a more clearly defined role. What are some things we know about gravity:
a.	It interacts with non-quantum matter
b.	Matter can resist it easily, as in the example of a butterfly flying
c.	In massive amounts, it is wildly powerful, and it can collapse stars into black holes
d.	It seems to exist in a field
e.	It is somehow a carrier of data
f.	Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, warping and stretching everything in “spacetime”, as if it were a fabric

This brings us to my first round of probable conclusions about gravity and the formation of the universe (I am open to edits here - I think this works AND I think someone should be able to run models/simulations on this but I also don’t know how that works. Either way seems like if someone can help make the below work (if/where) I fail, then we are in great shape with this full picture):
1.	Gravitons exist in space in wave form. They are “moving” at the speed of light. Since they are in wave form, they are not constrained by the same laws as matter, so while we might say they are “moving” at the speed of light, they are not – they are simply *existing* at the speed of light (in multiple places at once – and not *zipping around* at light speed as one might want to think)
2.	Gravitons interact directly with matter, while they are in wave form
3.	Matter is not attracted to itself, BUT the graviton field’s general tendency (I’m not calling it a gravity field for a reason) is to behave as if individual gravitons are attracted to *each other*. Since gravitons as waves are not matter, and matter exists within its field, this results in a general tendency to behave like the displacement of water around a basketball – but NOT exactly the same. It will squeeze into the ball. Except there’s a lot more going on in the quantum world than just that. Gravitons don’t eventually come to rest like water would a few minutes after you dunk the basketball (though in theory, the universe is probably approaching this state of homeostasis, and it would take a few trilliontrillion  years). A large mass of matter creates a void that increases the intensity of the “flow” of gravity around it, towards its center. It has disturbed the homeostasis of “a-general-tendency-to-behave-as-if-they-are-attracted-to-each-other- even-though-they-are-waves” by inserting itself between gravitons. In the case of stars, how many particles can you fit inside the volume of a star? That’s how many gravitons a star has come between.
4.	Since the big bang, gravitons have ‘flowed’ in this manner for billions of years. When the first tiny pieces of matter touched each other, the “graviton field” around the objects increased its flow towards the center of the 2 objects very slightly. Just enough for some of them to stick together long enough to bump into a third piece of matter. Then a 4th.
5.	As the masses got bigger, so too did the inward force of the gravitons around them (towards their center). Large objects continued getting larger, and stars and planets were formed.
6.	[It might be the case that there has to be at least 2 particles for there to be any disturbance. 1 particle could be what theoretical “homeostasis” is like, OR all matter including individual particles might cause a tiny disturbance. It will absolutely change the math, but I don’t know how. Since it’s a binary variable, I think that means it will be easy for you to plug in numbers.]
7.	Around each large object is an *area of gravitational influence* but it is not a “gravitational field” per se. It is actually just a function of how much the object is disturbing the general tendency of gravitons to act as if they are attracted to themselves, we can call it the ‘essence current’. So, the disturbance should appear a bit like a ring, and the outer area of the ring at the point where the gravitational field is no longer disturbed by the object, would be the limit of the object’s influence on gravity. So whatever is around a large mass is more appropriately called a “ring of graviton [or gravitational] disturbance”. “Gravity” that pulls us back down to earth when we jump, is actually us jumping into a relatively powerful downward stream of essence current!
8.	Outside of any rings of graviton disturbance, gravitons are “flowing” more freely (but really just existing), NOT exactly in a mathematical homeostasis, but in a function that is approaching homeostasis outside of other disturbances, and still with a general tendency to behave as if gravitons are attracted to each other. 
9.	Whenever 2 large moving bodies of matter have an overlap in their ring of graviton disturbance, the gravitational force directly between them becomes ‘neutral’. Since the force of homeostasis on the opposite sides of each body is greater than a neutral zero, those two bodies would move towards the neutral area between each other (not even really to each other;).
a.	*This one is pretty close, but I need to think out the ‘neutral’ part, there might be a slight difference here you can help me with!
10.	If their momentum is strong enough, after their trajectory has altered slightly, they would continue in their new trajectory, but their momentum would decrease proportionate to the amount of energy required to overcome the relative attraction to the ‘neutral zone’.
11.	If many large objects across the universe were doing this, over time, a spiral effect would occur, contributing to the formation of a spiral galaxy. Theoretically a galaxy could form and ultimately momentum could overpower the force of gravity and it would come apart, but more likely most (if not all) galaxies are EITHER around today because they have reached a homeostasis (like a solar system) OR some, or all, are in a state of implosion (ultimately leading to supermassive black holes). If measurements are available, there should be a proportional relationship between galaxies and supermassive black holes, and stars and normal black holes (whatever that is). Though, since galaxies don’t have any standardized mass, there might not be a discernable point where you could say OK this was a galaxy. But, a full galactic black hole, now that would be something.
12.	Gravitons and ‘essence particles’ (dark matter) are both quantum particles of data that coexist in the same field. The ‘essence field’ is both the gravitational field AND the dark matter field (they are not distinct, and neither exists)
13.	I call this field the ‘essence field’
14.	The essence field is *quantum memory*, the ‘storage’ area for quantum data. I think this is the same as saying space-time is this field of “quantum essence memory”, but as you will see later, time is another rabbit hole and I am not making that leap yet.

That was a lot to take in. I (might be/almost definitely am) missing something, but it looks like we are hot on the right trail. We don’t need the above right now to be perfect; since it seems plausible, we can keep going and see what else falls into place (or doesn’t):

It brings us to the next round of questions:
•	What would the properties of memory be in this context?
•	What are its limitations?
•	Does it delete anything?
•	HOW would it delete something?
•	WHY would it delete something?

So, if we start by thinking of deletion: When you delete data – it just disappears. But physics today says that’s impossible, nothing can be zapped out of existence. And here’s the rub. We were told matter can neither be created nor destroyed. We’ve shown that it can be created. We theorized a cycle. And here, just as we are trying to wrap up the full cycle and needing to reconcile the creation of something from nothing - one of the last remaining frontiers, black holes, for the first time ever, have come to save the day in a Physics problem. Please at least give me credit for making black holes the good guy for once. 

[Much of] Modern Physics says black holes are impossible, because matter is sucked into a vacuum of nothingness and zapped out of existence and we don’t see how that fits in with the other “rules” of physics we have. There’s a “black hole information paradox”. This document does not include my correlating findings on Math – but that document, derived from the rules here, predicts a donut shaped universe with empty space outside of it. This would neatly wrap up the black hole paradox, as it gives quantum and non-quantum “stuff” a place to go. It also works for me, in that it helps continue a giant universal cycle of nature.

This has gotten us to, ok, so, how would the universe efficiently run this cycle of deletion? What would make the most sense? What is the framework to approach this from?
1.	We want ‘essence particles’ to be *safe*
2.	We care less about gravitons
3.	Both exist and have a role

Given our assumption that black holes are a part of a universe-spanning cyclical natural process, and they are the deletion of data, HOW would this ‘essence field of memory’ even initiate the deletion process? Answer: The deletion process is just always happening. Deletion is part of the cycle, and it is the cycle that causes the deletion.

Here’s what we (know/assume) that is relevant now:
1.	Less desirable gravitons, acting as waves, behave with a general tendency to be attracted to each other, while essence particles (as waves) demonstrate no tendency towards anything (I haven’t thought deeply this part yet, but so far, not relevant. Maybe they are attracted to nothing, maybe to themselves, maybe just away from gravitons, we don’t need to know that yet.)
2.	Memory, as in the form of computer storage, has a limit, or a threshold
3.	To *exceed* the quantum memory threshold would be *catastrophic*
4.	Any given volume of space, small or large, will be able to hold a finite amount of data. This will be called “essence memory threshold”

And this is how we have (maybe) solved the problem of gravity, gravitons, black holes, dark matter, dark field, etc. I believe the math has already been done – the essence field memory threshold will be a function of Planck Scale and/or Planck Time. Given current assumptions here’s more on what we would expect to happen:

1.	When we try to measure something smaller than a Planck length, the energy of measuring/interacting with this space will cause it to exceed the ‘essence memory threshold’
2.	This results in deletion, or, a black hole. I believe the math to prove this already exists as well
3.	I call the smallest unit of memory, Planck-Leo memory, because I have to totally make it up and if Planck is right, then obv. needs his dues)
4.	This event only happens in nature when a large amount of data is gathered in one space, and an incredible, universe-ripping amount of force squeezes it so hard it occupies an amount of space that cannot contain it. It passes the ‘essence memory threshold’ and is deleted.
5.	This deletion, what happens in a black hole, is called *Fennsmash*
a.	Now, I am working on what happens to both the matter and gravitons, and we have to wrap this theory up so I can share it. We’ll end this first installment with what I am currently working on. After a hole is ripped in the ‘essence field’ and Fennsmash occurs, one of two things would occur:
i.	Only the matter being squeezed is deleted. In this case, there would be no vacuum effect. Gravitons would clap back together, and a big graviton wave would shoot out from center. Sounds possible based on this theory so far, but not from what I think I know about black holes. Option 2:
ii.	This rip creates a vacuum, and surrounding matter AND all particles are sucked in. In which case, it seems there IS another side. This does work very well, because in this process, since gravitons will always be closest to a black hole, it demonstrates a continuance of the cycle – the natural state of the universe is such that “less wanted” graviton particles have a tendency to collect in a way that situates them in proximity to cosmic “trash cans” and since gravitons tend to collect there, essence particles would be *safe* from this volatility.
iii.	Also, it would take a whole lot of *time* before anything got deleted. There would not be any black holes until stars had formed and collapsed, so the deletion process wouldn’t happen until a lot of data had been collected.

This is the Quantum Cycle, a working metaphysical solution for the story of everything based on all (we/I) know of *all* science. All living beings are a beautiful part of it. The speed of light – I think it works in as the speed of thought. It is the only way to ‘exist’ in the quantum world. 

I think time would work out to be: a lot of little experience loops unique to each individual. It exists only around living beings; computers would have difficulty comprehending time like we do (probably a thing in computer science?).  Experiencing a vivid memory would likely be very hard to distinguish from *actual* time travel. Since time would not be *one* big loop but many, that will definitely shake things up for Math and other established Physics “rules” but we need a complete picture, and this one seems to work. 

It would be great to have Physicists to look for MORE things that FIT instead of stretching for what doesn’t. With the help of more educated minds in all fields, we could build off of this framework. 

1.	It has taken me about 15 days to put all of this together. I am either dreadfully wrong, or if anything, unabashedly amazed at my own creativity in making this up. This is a LOT for someone self-taught to just write down in a flow of consciousness. Maybe I need to write a book.
